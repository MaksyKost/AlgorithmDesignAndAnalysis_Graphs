# AlgorithmDesignAndAnalysis_Graphs
Implementation and benchmarking of graph algorithms (C++).

# Algorithm design and analysis: Graphs
Graph Algorithms: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, and Depth-First Search (DFS)

This repository was created for the Data Design and Analysis course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

# 📌 Goal

To implement and compare three graph algorithms:

- Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Bellman-Ford Algorithm

- Depth-First Search (DFS)

## ⚙️ Implemented features
Graph representation:

- Adjacency Matrix

- Adjacency List

Random graph generation with configurable:

- Number of vertices (10, 50, 100, 200, 500)

- Graph density (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)

Graph algorithms:

- Finding shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)

- Graph traversal (DFS)

## 🧪 Benchmarking

Execution time measured for different graph sizes and densities

100 random instances per configuration

Results are saved to results/ as .csv files

Visualized and analyzed in the final report

## 🛠️ Technologies

Language: C++

Graph visualization with Graphviz
